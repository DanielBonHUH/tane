    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>The Department of Education was established through the Education</p>
<p>Decree of 1863 as the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction</p>
<p>under a Chairman.</p> <p>The Education agency underwent many reorganization</p>
<p>efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the</p>
<p>changing administrations and charters.</p> 
<p>The present day Department of Education</p>
<p>was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise</p>
<p>known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 2001 which establishes</p>
<p>the mandate of this agency.</p>

        <br><p>The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements,</p>
<p>and coordinates policies, plans, programs and projects in the areas of formal</p>
<p>and non-formal basic education.</p> <p>It supervises all elementary and secondary</p>
<p>education institutions, including alternative learning systems, both</p>
<p>public and private; and provides for the establishment and maintenance of</p>
<p>a complete, adequate, and integrated system of basic education relevant to</p>
<p>the goals of national development.</p><br>
