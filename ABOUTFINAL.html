    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>The Department of Education was established through the Education</p>
<p>Decree of 1863 as the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction</p>
<p>under a Chairman.</p> <p>The Education agency underwent many reorganization</p>
<p>efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the</p>
<p>changing administrations and charters.</p>

	<br><h1>THE CREATION OF ROSALES NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL</h1>
<p>The Rosales National High School which caters to secondary</p>
<p>school youths of Rosales and its neighboring towns, Rosales National High School</p>
<p>was founded in 1945 through the initiative of public school</p>
<p>officials and prominent and civic- spirited of the town, namely: the late</p>
<p>Mayor Felix Coloma, Dona Petra Callanta, Don Francisco delos Reyes, Don Isidro Casanova,</p>
<p>Don Conrado Estrella Sr. In September 1945,</p>
<p>the school then known as Rosales Junior High School has under each educational</p>
<p>wing the first year students in 1941 that were overtaken by the outbreak</p><p>
</p><p>of the Pacific war in World War II on December 8, 1941. The fresh-men </p>
<p>and sophomore classes were housed temporarily in the Plaridel College Building.</p><br>

<p>From Plaridel College, the school was transferred to another site</p>
<p>which is currently occupied by the Rosales North Central School where</p>
<p>Quonset Buildings vacated by the American Soldiers were then used as classrooms.</p>
<p><br>While classes were going on, the founding fathers and the PTA negotiated</p>
<p>for the purchased of a permanent site, meticulously chosen because</p>
<p>of its healthful environment that is conducive to learning, more footage</p>
<p>to futuristic expansion and its ideal location in terms of proximity to</p>
<p>the main thoroughfares of the town.</p>
<p><br>Assured of the funds, the PTA Board of Directors negotiated with the heirs</p>
<p>of the late Mr. Alejandro Pablo regarding the contemplated purchase of his</p>
<p>lot situated in the Poblacion of Rosales.</p><br>
<p>The new site has an area of 72, 634 square meters under title 22452/</p><p>
</p><p>registered on February 9, 1957 under TCT No. 1029. It cost the PTA Php 50,843.20</p>
<p>as down payment to acquire the cogonal land.</p>
<p><br>In S.Y 1946-1947, the PTA was determined to transfer the school</p>
<p>to the chosen site. For donations of parents and civic spirited citizens,</p>
<p>shacks were constructed and were furnished by the facilities of the Plaridel College</p>
<p>donated by Dona Teodora Serafica and family. In this school site</p>
<p>were enrolled 51 fourth year students and 200 first year students.</p>
<p>The first class of 32 males and 16 females were graduated.</p><br>
<p>As time goes by, there are so many changes happened in the school</p>
<p>in terms of the buildings, curricula, number of teachers and number of students.</p>
<p>Currently, the total number of enrollees in school is about 5,151</p>
<p>as of march 4, 2018. In that case the Rosales NHS is one of the biggest</p>
<p>National High School in the Division of Pangasinan II.</p>
<br><p>In terms of acquisition of learning,</p>
<p>before it is only a matter of learning, just giving the ideas to the learners in order for them to internalized</p>
<p>on what is going on and on what will be in the next generation but today,</p>
<p>it is not just a ingesting of ideas but it is more one practical matter,</p>
<p>the of learning today is more on hands-on-minds-on process it focusses on outcome</p>
<p>based wherein in all things that they have learned must put into action</p>
